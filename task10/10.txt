Task 10: Create a Storage account and explore all the option while creating Upload and access the blob Go through different Auth. Tech and test the same Try Azure storage explorer Provision Access keys and use them for connection with storage account Create a Shared access signature and check access scope Create a stored access policy over shared access signature and check access scope Learn about different access tiers and their use cases Apply lifecycle policy over objects and test the same test object replication in blob Create a file share and test functionality Create a Azure File sync

ðŸ”¹ Create Storage Account
1.Opened Azure Portal â†’ Searched Storage Accounts â†’ Clicked Create.

2.Selected resource group, region, performance tier, and redundancy option.

2.Applied policy to blobs and verified automated tier changes.

ðŸ”¹ Object Replication
1.Enabled blob replication between storage accounts in different regions.

2.Uploaded blobs to primary and confirmed replication.

ðŸ”¹ File Share
