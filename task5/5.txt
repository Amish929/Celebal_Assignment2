Task 5: Create a VNet with 2 Subnets and 4 More VNets (Hub-and-Spoke Architecture)

ðŸ”¹ A. Create a VNet with 2 Subnets
1.Opened Azure Portal â†’ Searched for Virtual Networks â†’ Clicked Create.

2.Created a VNet (e.g., MainVNet) and added two subnets:

5.Completed the setup and deployed Linux & Windows VMs in Subnet-1.

 B. Create 4 Separate VNets
1.Created the following VNets one by one:

2.Management VNet (Hub)

3.Production VNet

4.Testing VNet

5.Development VNet

6.Configured address ranges to avoid overlap.

ðŸ”¹ Configure Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
1.Set up VNet peering from each spoke VNet (Prod, Test, Dev) to the Management VNet.

2.Enabled Allow forwarded traffic and Use remote gateway in peering settings.

3.Created one VM in each VNet.

ðŸ”¹ Verify Connectivity
1.Logged into the VM in the Management VNet.

2.Pinged all other VMs from it using their private IPs.

3.Confirmed connectivity was successful.
